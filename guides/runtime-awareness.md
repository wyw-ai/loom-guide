# Runtime Awareness

Loom no longer relies on a long Loom-owned system prompt to teach agents how the runtime works. Stable runtime awareness is split across three surfaces:

- `AGENTS.md` in the agent workspace contains stable actor/channel facts and concise operating rules.
- The default `loom` skill routes common situations to the right action or guide topic.
- `loom guide` contains the detailed official manual.

Dynamic facts stay out of `AGENTS.md`: current trigger, thread, task, assignment, latest message, local time, private-trigger state, and other turn-specific values belong in the current prompt or environment.

## AGENTS.md

Loom writes a generated block into `{agent.workspace}/AGENTS.md` using these markers:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN loom -->
...
<!-- END loom -->
```

Rules:

- If the file does not exist, Loom creates it.
- If the file exists without markers, Loom prepends the generated block.
- If the markers exist, Loom refreshes the block when stable actor/channel facts change.
- Content outside the markers is owned by the user or project and must be preserved.

The block should contain stable facts only:

- actor id and display name;
- channel id, title, topic, and stable membership;
- workspace path;
- AgentSpec static instructions;
- concise pointers to the Loom skill and guide.

## Runtime Environment

Inside a daemon-managed agent turn, common environment variables include:

```text
LOOM_SERVER
LOOM_DAEMON_SOCKET
LOOM_ACTOR
LOOM_CHANNEL_ID
LOOM_SCOPE_ID
LOOM_SCOPE_KIND
LOOM_REPLY_TARGET
LOOM_RUN_ID
LOOM_TRIGGER_MESSAGE_ID
LOOM_TRIGGER_ACTOR
LOOM_TRIGGER_PRIVATE
LOOM_TRIGGER_PRIVATE_TO
LOOM_TRIGGER_PRIVATE_TO_FLAGS
```

Treat these values as current-turn context. If a value is missing or ambiguous, query the server with `loom --json ...`.

## Prompt Boundary

Default provider prompts should not include a Loom runtime manual as a system prompt. Providers should receive the composed turn payload, usually `{prompt.full}`, while native instruction discovery reads `AGENTS.md` and projected skills from the workspace.

`prompt.system` may still exist as a configurable output for compatibility, memory, or user-defined provider templates, but Loom's default providers should not append a Loom-owned system prompt.

## State Freshness

Do not rely on memory or local files for current collaboration state. Before acting on mutable state, query Loom:

```bash
loom --json channel list
loom --json channel members "$LOOM_CHANNEL_ID"
loom --json thread list
loom --json message read --target "$LOOM_REPLY_TARGET"
loom --json message search --query "keyword" --target "$LOOM_REPLY_TARGET"
loom --json task list --source-message "$LOOM_TRIGGER_MESSAGE_ID"
loom --json inbox list --no-ack
```

Use `--include-private` only when you intentionally need private messages addressed to you.

Use `channel members` when deciding who is present in the current channel. The global actor registry can contain actors from other contexts.

Read more history only when it changes the decision. In fast discussions and coordinated rounds, recent history is the work; re-read enough to avoid repeating or skipping someone. In a self-contained task assignment, prefer the injected assignment context and fetch only the extra facts the task needs.
